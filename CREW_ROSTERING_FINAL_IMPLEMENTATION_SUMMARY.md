### 6. Complete Database with Realistic Data
- Enhanced database with realistic sample data:
  - 5 airports across major Indian cities
  - 2 aircraft types (A320, A321)
  - 1,000 crew members with real names, various ranks and bases
  - 1,316 crew qualifications with expiry dates
  - 20 crew preferences for the first 10 crew members
  - 13,500 flights scheduled over 30 days
  - 500 duty periods linking crew members to flights
  - 500 duty flights linking duty periods to specific flights
  - 1 set of DGCA constraints with all enhanced regulatory parameters

## API Endpoints

### Rostering
- `POST /v1/rosters/generate` - Generate crew roster
- `GET /v1/rosters/{roster_id}` - Retrieve specific roster

### Rerostering
- `POST /v1/reroster` - Handle disruptions (delays, cancellations, crew unavailability)
- `POST /v1/ai/reroster_suggest` - Get AI suggestions for rerostering
- `POST /v1/ai/handle_disruption` - Handle disruptions with AI assistance

### Health
- `GET /v1/health` - System health check

## Database Schema

The enhanced database includes the following tables:
1. `airport` - Airport information
2. `aircraft_type` - Aircraft type definitions
3. `crew` - Crew member details
4. `crew_qualification` - Crew qualifications with expiry dates
5. `crew_preference` - Crew preferences with weights
6. `flight` - Flight schedule information
7. `dgca_constraints` - DGCA regulatory constraints
8. `duty_period` - Duty periods for crew members
9. `duty_flight` - Link between duty periods and flights
