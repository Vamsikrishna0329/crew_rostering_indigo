# Crew Rostering Optimization and Predictive Analytics Enhancements

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Crew Rostering system to implement optimization and predictive analytics capabilities using Google OR-Tools and scikit-learn.

## 1. Google OR-Tools Integration

### Implementation Details
- Created a new optimization module `backend/app/optimizer/or_tools_opt.py`
- Implemented constraint satisfaction problem solving for crew rostering
- Added support for qualification constraints, availability constraints, and DGCA rules
- Integrated with the existing rules engine for compliance checking

### Key Features
- Advanced constraint satisfaction using Google OR-Tools CP-SAT solver
- Optimization of crew assignments based on preferences and fairness metrics
- Support for complex scheduling constraints
- Fallback to simple optimization if OR-Tools cannot find a solution

## 2. Scikit-learn Predictive Analytics

### Implementation Details
- Created a new analytics module `backend/app/analytics/predictive_analytics.py`
- Implemented machine learning models for pattern analysis and prediction
- Added clustering analysis for crew duty patterns
- Created predictive models for crew availability and performance

### Key Features
- **Crew Pattern Analysis**: Clustering algorithms to identify duty patterns
- **Availability Prediction**: Machine learning models to predict crew availability
- **Performance Prediction**: Predictive models for crew performance based on historical data
- **Risk Pattern Identification**: Analysis of scheduling risks and potential disruptions

## 3. API Endpoints

### New Analytics Endpoints
- `GET /v1/analytics/patterns/crew` - Analyze crew patterns
- `GET /v1/analytics/predict/availability/{crew_id}/{prediction_date}` - Predict crew availability
- `GET /v1/analytics/predict/performance` - Predict crew performance
- `GET /v1/analytics/risks` - Identify risk patterns

### Enhanced Rostering Endpoint
- `POST /v1/rosters/generate` now accepts an `optimization_method` parameter
  - `"simple"` (default): Original heuristic-based optimization
  - `"or_tools"`: Advanced constraint satisfaction optimization

## 4. Frontend Integration

### UI Enhancements
- Added optimization method selection dropdown to the roster generation interface
- Users can now choose between "Simple Heuristics" and "OR-Tools (Advanced)" optimization methods

## 5. Backend Architecture

### Module Structure
- Created `backend/app/analytics/` package for predictive analytics modules
- Updated `backend/app/optimizer/` package to include OR-Tools optimization
- Enhanced `backend/app/services/orchestrator.py` to support both optimization methods
- Updated API schemas and routes to accommodate new features

### Dependencies
- Added `ortools`, `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `numpy` to `backend/requirements.txt`

## 6. Usage Examples

### Generate Roster with OR-Tools Optimization
```json
POST /v1/rosters/generate
{
  "period_start": "2025-09-06",
  "period_end": "2025-09-20",
  "rules_version": "v1",
  "optimization_method": "or_tools"
}
```

### Analyze Crew Patterns
```bash
GET /v1/analytics/patterns/crew
```

### Predict Crew Availability
```bash
GET /v1/analytics/predict/availability/123/2025-09-15
```

## 7. Benefits

### Improved Optimization
- More efficient crew assignments with better preference satisfaction
- Enhanced compliance with DGCA regulations
- Improved fairness in duty distribution

### Predictive Capabilities
- Proactive identification of scheduling risks
- Data-driven decision making for crew management
- Better resource planning based on predictive insights

### Flexibility
- Choice between simple heuristics and advanced optimization
- Extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Machine learning models that can be retrained with new data

## 8. Dependency Management

### Resolving Conflicts
- Specified compatible package versions in requirements.txt
- Added protobuf version constraint to resolve conflicts
- Documented dependency resolution steps in README.md

## 9. Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
- Real-time optimization for dynamic scheduling
- Integration with external data sources for enhanced predictions
- Advanced visualization of analytics results
- Automated model retraining and evaluation
