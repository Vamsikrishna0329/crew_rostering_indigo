# AI-Powered Crew Rostering POC for IndiGo - Analysis and Enhancement Plan

## Current Implementation Overview

### 1. Architecture
The system is built with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend. The backend follows a modular architecture with:
- API layer (`backend/app/api/`) handling HTTP requests
- Services layer (`backend/app/services/`) containing business logic
- AI/LLM integration (`backend/app/ai/`) for intelligent suggestions
- Rules engine (`backend/app/rules/`) for compliance checking
- Optimizer (`backend/app/optimizer/`) for roster generation
- Data models and storage (`backend/app/storage/`) using SQLite
- Data schemas (`backend/app/schemas/`) using Pydantic

### 2. Core Components

#### AI Service (`backend/app/services/ai_service.py`)
- Builds context for flights including qualified crew members
- Integrates with LLM agent to generate rostering suggestions
- Handles both specific flight rerostering and general queries

#### LLM Agent (`backend/app/ai/llm_agent.py`)
- Interfaces with external LLM APIs (configured via settings)
- Provides structured JSON responses for rostering actions
- Handles both patch suggestions and freeform queries

#### Rules Engine (`backend/app/rules/engine.py`)
- Enforces basic DGCA compliance rules:
  - Maximum duty hours per day
  - Minimum rest hours between duties
  - Maximum Flight Duty Period (FDP) hours

#### Optimizer (`backend/app/optimizer/simple_opt.py`)
- Generates basic roster assignments
- Handles re-rostering for flight delays
- Respects crew qualifications and availability

#### Data Models (`backend/app/storage/models.py`)
- Comprehensive data model including:
  - Airports, aircraft types
  - Crew information with qualifications
  - Flight schedules
  - Duty periods and assignments
  - DGCA constraints

## Gap Analysis with Use Case Requirements

### 1. DGCA Compliance Rules
**Current Implementation:**
- Basic rules engine with configurable parameters
- Stored in database table `dgca_constraints`

**Gaps Identified:**
- Limited to only three basic parameters
- No handling of complex DGCA rules (e.g., weekly limits, monthly limits)
- No consideration of crew rank-specific rules

### 2. Crew Qualification Handling
**Current Implementation:**
- Crew qualifications stored in `crew_qualification` table
- Basic filtering by aircraft type during assignment

**Gaps Identified:**
- No handling of qualification expiry dates
- No consideration of rank requirements for specific flights
- No preference-based assignment logic

### 3. Disruption Handling
**Current Implementation:**
- Basic delay handling in re-rostering API
- Simple feasibility check for delayed flights

**Gaps Identified:**
- No handling of cancellations
- No handling of crew unavailability (sickness, etc.)
- No cascading effect analysis for disruptions
- No historical disruption data integration

### 4. Roster Optimization with Fairness
**Current Implementation:**
- Simple first-fit assignment algorithm
- Basic KPIs for assignment rate

**Gaps Identified:**
- No fairness metrics (equal distribution of duties)
- No consideration of crew preferences
- No overtime/standby optimization
- No complex optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, constraint programming)

### 5. AI/LLM Integration
**Current Implementation:**
- Basic LLM integration for suggestions
- Structured JSON output for actions

**Gaps Identified:**
- Limited context provided to LLM
- No learning from historical data
- No feedback loop for improving suggestions
- No handling of complex rostering scenarios

  - Training schedules

### 3. Comprehensive Disruption Handling
**Implementation Plan:**
- Extend re-rostering API to handle:
  - Cancellations
