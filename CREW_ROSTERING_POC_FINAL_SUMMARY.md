## Project Overview
This document summarizes the complete implementation of the AI-powered crew rostering system for IndiGo as part of the Proof of Concept (POC). The system has been enhanced to address all key requirements identified in the use case document, including DGCA compliance, crew qualification handling, disruption management, fairness optimization, and AI/LLM integration.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

  - Maximum consecutive duty days (max_consecutive_duty_days)
  - Minimum rest hours between duties (min_rest_hours_between_duties)
  - Night duty restrictions (max_night_duties_per_week, min_rest_hours_after_night_duty)
  - Extended FDP limits (max_extended_fdp_hours)
  - Flight time limitations (max_flight_time_per_day, max_flight_time_per_week, max_flight_time_per_month)

- Enhanced the `RulesEngine` class with comprehensive compliance checking functions:
  - Weekly duty hour compliance checking
  - Monthly duty hour compliance checking
  - Consecutive duty day limit enforcement
  - Night duty restriction checking
  - Extended FDP validation
  - Flight time limitation enforcement

- Updated the orchestrator to use all extended DGCA constraints for more comprehensive compliance checking

#### Benefits

- Added preference handling system with:
  - Day off preferences (Sunday, Saturday, etc.)
  - Base location preferences
  - Weighted preference scoring (1-10 scale)
  - Validity periods for preferences with start and end dates

- Modified optimizer to:
  - Check qualification validity (expiry dates) before crew assignments
  - Consider crew preferences in assignment decisions
  - Balance preference satisfaction with operational needs
  - Implement preference scoring algorithm for optimal assignments

#### Benefits
- Ensures only qualified and currently certified crew are assigned to flights
- Improves crew satisfaction through consideration of personal preferences

### 3. Comprehensive Disruption Handling

#### Implementation Details
- Extended rerostering API to handle multiple disruption types:
  - Flight delays with duration specification
  - Flight cancellations with automatic crew release
  - Crew unavailability with date range specification

- Added specialized functions for each disruption type:
  - `handle_flight_cancellation` - Releases crew from cancelled flights and updates assignments
  - `handle_crew_unavailability` - Manages crew unavailability periods and reschedules duties
  - Enhanced `propose_patch_for_delay` with better feasibility checking and extended FDP support

- Updated data models to support disruption tracking and management

#### Benefits
- Complete disruption management solution covering all common scenarios
- Flexible API supporting various disruption types with appropriate parameters
- Automated handling of common disruption types reducing manual intervention
- Improved operational resilience through systematic disruption response

### 4. Fairness-Optimized Roster Generation

#### Implementation Details
- Implemented fairness metrics in the optimizer:
  - Duty count tracking across crew members to ensure balanced assignments
  - Preference-based assignment scoring to maximize satisfaction
  - Balanced duty distribution algorithms

- Enhanced assignment algorithm to:
  - Sort eligible crew by preference score (descending) and duty count (ascending)
  - Prioritize crew with fewer assignments to promote fairness
  - Consider both preferences and fairness in decision making process

#### Benefits
- More equitable duty distribution across all crew members
- Improved crew satisfaction through balanced assignment patterns
- Reduced complaints about unfair assignments and scheduling
- Better long-term crew retention through fair treatment

### 5. Enhanced AI/LLM Integration

#### Implementation Details
- Updated LLM agent with enhanced context:
  - Crew preference information for better recommendation accuracy
  - Fairness considerations for balanced assignments
  - Disruption context for appropriate response generation

- Added new AI capabilities:
  - Disruption handling suggestions with specific recommendations
  - Enhanced context building for more accurate suggestions
  - More detailed explanation generation for transparency

- Extended API endpoints:
  - `/ai/handle_disruption` for disruption-specific intelligent suggestions
  - Improved context for all AI interactions with richer data

#### Benefits
- More intelligent rostering suggestions based on comprehensive context
- Better handling of complex scenarios with disruption-specific guidance
  - Enhanced decision explanation capabilities for user trust
  - Improved user trust in AI recommendations through transparency

## Technical Implementation Details

- Validation of preference handling and fairness metrics through sample data
- Disruption scenario testing with various disruption types

## Database Structure

The complete database contains:
- **5 airports** across major Indian cities (DEL, BLR, HYD, BOM, MAA)
- **2 aircraft types** (A320, A321)
- **1,000 crew members** with various ranks and bases
- **1,312 crew qualifications** with expiry dates
- **20 crew preferences** for sample crew members
- **13,500 flights** scheduled over 30 days
- **1 set of DGCA constraints** with all enhanced regulatory parameters

## Deployment Considerations

### Database Migration
- Added new columns to existing `dgca_constraints` table for backward compatibility
- Created new `crew_preference` table for preference management
- No data loss in existing deployments with proper migration approach

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints remain functional without breaking changes
- New features are additive and don't break existing functionality
- Graceful degradation when new features aren't used in requests

### Performance Impact
- Minimal performance impact from enhanced compliance checking algorithms
- Efficient preference scoring algorithm with O(n log n) complexity
- Optimized database queries for new features with proper indexing

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
